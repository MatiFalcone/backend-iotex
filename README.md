PolyTools GraphQL Backend
-------------------------

This is the first version of the PolyTools backend.

At the moment, it retrieves mocked data for the tokens and gets data also from a very easy API, just to show how it works.

# To do:

1. Add PolygonScan API.
2. Add 0x API.
3. Add BitQuery GraphQL.
4. Add The Graph subgraphs.
5. Add any other data source we want.

# Nice to have: 

1. Add graphql-jit library for cache (better performance).
